# The dominance of gene expression and phentoypic heterosis

This is an ongoing research project. It was intended for internal lab usage. It has not been extensively tested. Use at your own risk.

In this study, we generated a large, population-wide RNA-seq dataset from 600 hybrids and their 200 inbred parents. 
Through integrative analysis, our results revealed that, under an Omnigenic model — in which all expressed genes contribute to traits within an interconnected network — Fisher’s modifier hypothesis aligns well with the observed patterns. Specifically, heterosis arises not from the inheritance of a single modified gene but through the coordinated regulation of hundreds of phenotype-associated core genes. 

# Project Guideline

- `01data`: 
  - the processed intermediate data

- `02table`: 
  - include the supplementary tables

- `03codes`: 
  - the code and scripts to generate the figures and results
